The software turns the RSS link from a website into a better one.

You can find the RSS link from a website, but it is usually hidden. To extract it you can use a browser extension like Get RSS Feed URL.

> Chromium Based: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-rss-feed-url/kfghpdldaipanmkhfpdcjglncmilendn
> Firefox Based: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/get-rss-feed-url/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search

You can then simply paste the link from the Website you want into Full Text RSS and have it generated.

You will then be redirected to a new URL. This is the better RSS feed. You can then add this web URL as a feed in Fresh RSS.

What then happens is. Full Text RSS pulls and customizes the feed from the pages and then Fresh RSS pulls it from Full Text RSS.
