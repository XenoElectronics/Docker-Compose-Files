My recomendet Apps for Music Editing:

>kid3-qt

>Musicbrainz Picard

The music itself must also be adapted for Navidrome and other metadata-based programs. This means in kid3-qt you have to make the artist and the album identical and in Musicbrainz Picard you have to take the folder and then click on Cluster at the top to group the data into an album.
